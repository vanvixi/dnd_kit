# Changelog

## 0.1.0-dev.2

- **Breaking:** removed `DndLongPressActivation.hapticFeedback`. Haptic
  feedback is now configured through `DndDraggable.enableHapticFeedback` or the
  nearest `DndScope.enableHapticFeedback` default, which defaults to `true`.
- Touch drag activation now emits one `HapticFeedback.selectionClick()` pulse
  by default when the drag starts, including both the platform-adaptive delayed
  touch path and explicit `longPressActivation`. Mouse, trackpad, and keyboard
  activations emit no haptic feedback.
- Fixed active drag geometry so overlays and collision detection stay aligned
  with the pointer when a scrollable ancestor moves during the drag.
- Draggables now work inside scrollables, including lazy `ListView.builder`.
  `DndDraggable` activates through an arena-winning `MultiDragGestureRecognizer`
  instead of a pan recognizer, so a drag can start without losing the gesture to
  an enclosing `Scrollable`.
- **Behavior change:** default activation is now platform-adaptive — precise
  pointers (mouse) drag immediately, while touch uses a short hold (delayed) so a
  quick touch can still scroll. Set
  `activationConstraint: DndSensorActivationConstraint(distance: …)` for
  immediate touch drag.
- Sortable strategies (`verticalList`, `horizontalList`, `grid`) now compute
  reorder intent from the measured (visible) item subset, so reordering stays
  correct in lazy lists where off-screen items are not measured.
- An active drag and its registration/measured rect now survive the source
  element being recycled by a lazy list mid-drag.
- Fixed a `Duplicate draggable/droppable id` crash that could occur while
  auto-scrolling a lazy list during a drag, when the list re-mounts a keyed
  item before disposing the old one. `findChildIndexCallback` is now a
  performance recommendation rather than a requirement.
- Duplicate `DndDraggable`/`DndDroppable` ids that remain mounted after widget
  reconciliation now surface an actionable `DndDiagnosticsConfig.onWarning`
  callback instead of staying silently last-wins.
- The Kanban and multi-container examples now use `ListView.builder` (with
  `findChildIndexCallback`) to demonstrate lazy sortable columns. The Kanban
  board is lazy in both axes — the horizontal column row and each column's
  vertical task list. Their task cards use the default platform-adaptive
  activation (immediate with a mouse, hold-to-drag on touch) so a quick swipe
  scrolls the list instead of starting a drag.
- Requires `dnd_kit_core` `^0.1.0-dev.2`.

## 0.1.0-dev.1

- Added a package-local `example/example.md` so pub.dev can render a compact
  illustrative example for the package.
- Clarified package README links to the quick example and full runnable
  repository examples.
- Updated the `dnd_kit_core` dependency to `^0.1.0-dev.1`.

## 0.1.0-dev.0

- Initial development release of the main `dnd_kit` Flutter package.
- Includes core drag/drop widgets, scope/controller APIs, pointer, long-press,
  and keyboard activation, measuring, collision runtime, modifiers, drag
  overlays, visual state builders, auto-scroll, diagnostics, and stable
  sortable list/grid presets.
- Exposes the pure Dart `dnd_kit_core` API through the main package for
  application convenience.
- Keeps experimental multi-container sortable helpers out of the stable
  same-container sortable contract.
