# Release Roadmap

This roadmap captures the major product phases that shaped the current
`dnd_kit` family. Durable implementation/proof status lives in
`scripts/bin/harness-cli query matrix`.

## Phase 0 - Repo Foundation And Architecture Freeze

Set up the monorepo, package structure, coding conventions, API direction, and
basic validation commands.

First story: `docs/stories/phase-0-foundation/US-001-repository-foundation.md`.

## Phase 1 - Core Engine

Build the pure Dart foundation:

- stable IDs;
- geometry types;
- drag state machine;
- event models;
- collision detectors;
- modifier contracts;
- registry contracts;
- sensor contracts.

## Phase 2 - Basic Flutter Adapter

Create the first Flutter adapter surface:

- `DndScope`;
- `DndController`;
- `DndDraggable`;
- `DndDroppable`;
- Flutter registry integration;
- basic measuring;
- drag event lifecycle.

## Phase 3 - Sensors And Activation

Support pointer, mouse, touch, long press, drag handles, and keyboard input.

## Phase 4 - Measuring, Collision Runtime, And Modifiers

Harden coordinate-space measuring, collision runtime behavior, custom collision
detectors, modifier composition, and cached measuring.

## Phase 5 - Overlay, Visual State, And Auto-Scroll

Complete drag overlay, draggable/droppable visual state, and common auto-scroll
behavior.

## Phase 6 - Stable Sortable Preset

Provide sortable vertical list, horizontal list, and grid APIs.

## Phase 7 - Kanban Showcase And Experimental Multi-Container

Use Kanban as a realistic proof that the generic engine supports complex UIs.

## Phase 8 - Production Hardening

Add diagnostics, performance baselines, cross-platform verification, docs, and
release-quality checks.

First story: `docs/stories/phase-8-production-hardening/US-031-release-quality-workspace-validation.md`.

Package polish before release also collapses the old umbrella-only `dnd_kit`
role into the primary Flutter package through
`docs/stories/phase-8-production-hardening/US-035-main-package-rename-and-umbrella-collapse.md`.

## Phase 9 - V1 Release Readiness

Prepare the renamed package for external review and publication:

- package-facing README and changelog;
- public API documentation polish;
- stale example documentation cleanup;
- publish dry-run and release metadata checks.

First story: `docs/stories/phase-9-release-readiness/US-036-docs-api-polish-before-release.md`.

## Phase 10 - Post-Publish Adoption

Improve the package after the first pub.dev publication by closing package
score gaps, keeping release metadata verifiable, and making adoption paths
clear for users.

First story: `docs/stories/phase-10-post-publish-adoption/US-037-pubdev-quality-package-example-pass.md`.

Adoption hardening also makes draggables and sortables work inside scrollables
and lazy `ListView.builder` lists through
`docs/stories/phase-10-post-publish-adoption/US-040-drag-inside-scrollable-and-lazy-lists/`
(see `docs/decisions/0010-draggable-arena-gesture.md`).

## Phase 11 - First Public Release

Cut the first stable public release line for the original engine, Flutter
adapter, and umbrella topology.

First story: `docs/stories/phase-11-first-public-release/US-046-publish-core-and-flutter-0-1-0.md`.

## Phase 12 - Multi-Framework Foundation

Prepare the package family for multiple adapters:

- rename the Flutter adapter package to `dnd_kit_flutter`;
- keep `dnd_kit` as the Flutter umbrella during the transitional topology;
- clarify family cross-links and package-selection guidance.

Key stories:

- `docs/stories/phase-12-multi-framework-foundation/US-043-rename-flutter-package-for-multi-framework.md`
- `docs/stories/phase-12-multi-framework-foundation/US-045-clarify-dnd-kit-scope-and-cross-link-family.md`

## Phase 13 - Shared Runtime Extraction

Move the framework-neutral drag runtime and measuring-cache contract into the
pure Dart engine so multiple adapters can share one drag engine.

Key story:

- `docs/stories/phase-13-shared-runtime-extraction/US-047-extract-shared-drag-runtime/overview.md`

## Phase 14 - Jaspr Adapter Foundation

Establish `dnd_kit_jaspr` as a browser/Jaspr peer adapter over the shared
engine:

- package scaffold;
- scope/controller;
- draggable/droppable;
- drag handle;
- drag overlay;
- browser modifier wiring and example proof.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-14-jaspr-foundation/README.md`.

## Phase 15 - Jaspr Adapter Hardening

Harden the Jaspr adapter for production browser behavior:

- browser auto-scroll execution;
- keyboard and accessibility support;
- diagnostics alignment with Flutter;
- first public Jaspr dev-release standardization.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-15-jaspr-hardening/README.md`.

## Phase 16 - Core As Brand Rename

Make the bare brand name `dnd_kit` the pure Dart engine, remove the Flutter
umbrella, and repoint both adapters to the renamed engine package.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-16-core-brand-rename/README.md`.

## Phase 17 - Flutter Upgrade And Workspace Unification

Upgrade the development Flutter SDK to 3.44.2 and fold the Jaspr example into
the shared workspace so the repository resolves as one package graph.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-17-flutter-upgrade-workspace/README.md`.

## Phase 18 - Jaspr Sortable Preset

Give `dnd_kit_jaspr` a sortable preset at parity with the Flutter adapter
(`SortableScope`, `SortableItem`) over the shared engine reorder math, so both
adapters compute identical move intent. Additive and adapter-local;
`dnd_kit_jaspr` bumps to `0.3.0-dev.1`.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-18-jaspr-sortable/README.md`.

## Phase 19 - Cross-Adapter Horizontal Auto-Scroll

Deliver horizontal auto-scroll for the shared engine and both adapters without
forking the edge-threshold or velocity math:

- discovery and design for one axis-aware core contract;
- Flutter execution adoption against the existing Kanban board reference;
- Jaspr execution adoption while preserving SSR safety and component-owned
  browser execution.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-19-horizontal-auto-scroll/README.md`.

## Phase 20 - Jaspr Example Feature Gallery

Expand the runnable Jaspr example into one tabbed feature gallery that
demonstrates the adapter's supported public surface in a real browser:

- generic drag/drop with handle + overlay;
- sortable preset;
- drag-driven auto-scroll;
- keyboard + live-region accessibility;
- shared-runtime modifiers.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-20-jaspr-example-gallery/README.md`.

## Phase 21 - Jaspr Adapter Fixes

Capture bounded adapter regressions found by the expanded browser gallery
without turning them into example-only work:

- keep the shared runtime as the single drag engine;
- land the smallest adapter-local contract fix;
- strengthen focused package/browser proof around the reproduced bug.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-21-jaspr-adapter-fixes/README.md`.

## Phase 22 - Coordinated Family Release Publication

Promote the `0.3.0-dev` line to a coordinated stable `0.3.0` pub.dev release
across the current package family:

- publish the `dnd_kit 0.3.0` engine release first;
- publish the matching `dnd_kit_flutter 0.3.0` adapter release second;
- publish the `dnd_kit_jaspr 0.3.0` adapter release third;
- keep changelog, dependency constraints, and proof aligned with the published
  order.

First story:
`docs/stories/phase-22-coordinated-family-release/US-069-publish-current-family-dev-line/overview.md`.

## Phase 23 - Flutter Accessibility Hardening

Close the remaining adapter accessibility gap after Jaspr's Phase 15 hardening
by giving `dnd_kit_flutter` a first-class Flutter-native accessibility story
for the next package patch release:

- configurable semantics labels and usage instructions for draggables and drag
  handles;
- optional assistive-technology announcements for drag lifecycle changes;
- focus-stable keyboard dragging with adapter-local execution over the shared
  runtime;
- package docs and changelog preparation for `dnd_kit_flutter 0.3.1`.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-23-flutter-accessibility-hardening/README.md`.

## Phase 24 - Shared Accessibility Contract

Remove duplicate accessibility contract code now that both adapters expose a
first-class a11y surface:

- move `DndAnnouncements` and its pure-Dart builders into `dnd_kit`;
- rewire `dnd_kit_flutter` and `dnd_kit_jaspr` to reuse the shared contract;
- keep Flutter semantics execution and Jaspr live-region execution
  adapter-local;
- shift default/custom announcement unit proof into the core package.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-24-shared-accessibility-contract/README.md`.

## Phase 25 - Coordinated Family Patch Release

Close the prepared `0.3.1` package line as one auditable family publication:

- publish `dnd_kit 0.3.1` first as the shared dependency root;
- publish `dnd_kit_flutter 0.3.1` second against `dnd_kit: ^0.3.1`;
- publish `dnd_kit_jaspr 0.3.1` third against `dnd_kit: ^0.3.1`;
- keep changelog truth, family dry-run proof, and the maintainer-run publish
  order explicit in one release packet.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-25-coordinated-family-patch-release/README.md`.

## Phase 28 - Cross-Adapter Multi-Container Parity

Close the remaining sortable parity gap between Flutter and Jaspr without
forking move-intent logic:

- hoist the experimental multi-container helpers into `dnd_kit`;
- preserve additive Flutter imports and behavior for existing experimental
  consumers;
- expose the same shared contract from `dnd_kit_jaspr`;
- prove that both adapters compute identical cross-container move intent over
  the shared engine.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-28-cross-adapter-multi-container/README.md`.

## Phase 29 - Production-Ready Multi-Container

Graduate multi-container from an experimental helper contract into a
production-ready feature with one supported behavior story across adapters:

- library-owned default interaction semantics for target resolution and
  insertion behavior;
- adapter-level multi-container surfaces so apps do not have to wire raw
  droppables, collision detectors, and drag-end intent logic by hand;
- app-owned presentation, animation, and state mutation preserved;
- explicit override hooks for products that need custom interaction policy.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-29-production-ready-multi-container/README.md`.

## Phase 30 - Website Multi-Container Showcase

Adopt the supported Jaspr multi-container surface in the hosted homepage's
Kanban centerpiece so the public site demonstrates the same production-ready
board/list contract that shipped in Phase 29:

- refactor the website Kanban showcase from app-owned raw droppable wiring to
  `SortableMultiScope` / `SortableMultiContainerArea` /
  `SortableMultiItem`;
- keep website visuals, telemetry, and state mutation app-owned;
- align homepage copy and release-roadmap truth with the supported
  multi-container surface.

Phase README: `docs/stories/phase-30-website-multi-container-showcase/README.md`.

## Phase 31 - Coordinated Family Stable 0.4.0 Release

Close the prepared `0.4.0-dev.1` package line as one coordinated stable family
publication after the multi-container graduation work has soaked:

- promote `dnd_kit` from `0.4.0-dev.1` to `0.4.0` as the dependency root;
- promote `dnd_kit_flutter` to `0.4.0` against `dnd_kit: ^0.4.0`;
- promote `dnd_kit_jaspr` to `0.4.0` against `dnd_kit: ^0.4.0`;
- keep changelog truth, dependency order, and dry-run proof aligned with the
  already-landed multi-container feature set.

Phase README:
`docs/stories/phase-31-coordinated-family-stable-0-4-0-release/README.md`.

## Phase 32 - Website Docs Page And Post-0.4.0 Doc Alignment

Close the docs/adoption gap left after the stable `0.4.0` publication:

- `US-080`: give the website a real Getting Started docs page on its own `/docs`
  route (replacing the in-page `#docs` placeholder) and align the root README
  status plus the Jaspr/Flutter package READMEs with the shipped stable `0.4.0`
  family;
- `US-081`: expand `/docs` into a multi-page docs section (shared sidebar shell,
  right-rail TOC, prev/next pager, Flutter|Jaspr code tabs) covering the nine
  core pages;
- `US-082`: complete the coverage with four more Concepts pages (collision,
  sensors, modifiers, auto-scroll), an API Reference page, and a collapsible
  mobile docs menu.

Phase README:
`docs/stories/phase-32-website-docs-page-and-doc-alignment/README.md`.

## Current State

The repository has implemented work through `US-079`. The Flutter adapter, the
pure Dart engine, and the Jaspr adapter share the `dnd_kit` brand family under
the post-US-060 topology, the workspace is unified under the Phase 17 toolchain,
and both adapters now ship a sortable preset over the shared engine. Phase 19
has now closed its discovery slice, its shared-core implementation slice, and
both adapter execution slices: horizontal auto-scroll is considered feasible
through an additive shared-core axis selector, `dnd_kit` exposes axis-aware
shared auto-scroll math, `dnd_kit_flutter` plus the Kanban example use that
shared contract for horizontal container auto-scroll, and `dnd_kit_jaspr`
mirrors the same contract for horizontal browser scroll containers while
keeping its auto-scroll execution component-owned. Phase 20 closes the runnable
Jaspr example gap with `examples/jaspr_example_gallery`, a tabbed feature
gallery covering drag/drop, sortable, auto-scroll, accessibility, and
modifiers over the shared runtime. Phase 21 then closes the next gallery-found
adapter regressions by restoring `DndDragOverlay` rebinding after a controlled
`DndScope` controller swap and fixing the Jaspr SSR handle-sync assertion.
Phase 23 then closes Flutter accessibility hardening by adding semantics
labels/hints, handle accessibility, and lifecycle announcements in the
`dnd_kit_flutter 0.3.1` line. Phase 24 then removes duplicate announcement
contract code by moving `DndAnnouncements` into `dnd_kit` while keeping Flutter
semantics execution and Jaspr live-region execution adapter-local. Phase 25 is
the closed release packet for those prepared package deltas as a coordinated
stable `0.3.1` family release; local proof passed and the three packages were
published in dependency order on 2026-06-20. Phase 26 then published the website
homepage to GitHub Pages via CI, and Phase 27 added affected-only validation to
the Validate CI workflow. Phase 28 then closed the last pure-Dart sortable
parity gap by moving the experimental multi-container helper contract into
`dnd_kit` and exposing it from both adapters without forking move-intent logic.
Phase 29 then promoted multi-container from helper parity to a production-ready
library feature: `dnd_kit` now owns the default board/list interaction policy,
both adapters expose `SortableMultiScope` / `SortableMultiContainerArea` /
`SortableMultiItem`, the Flutter example now uses that supported surface, and
Jaspr browser proof exercises the same behavior over the shared engine.
Phase 30 then upgraded the hosted Jaspr homepage Kanban showcase to that same
supported multi-container surface, replacing the stale app-owned raw-droppable
assembly path while keeping the website's own visuals, telemetry, and state
mutation local to the site. Phase 31 then closed the stable family release
packet for that line: the prepared `0.4.0-dev.1` family metadata was promoted
to stable `0.4.0`, local release proof passed through the shared verifier, and
the three packages published to pub.dev in dependency order on 2026-06-24:
`dnd_kit 0.4.0` -> `dnd_kit_flutter 0.4.0` -> `dnd_kit_jaspr 0.4.0`.
Phase 32 then closed the post-release docs/adoption gap: `US-080` gave the
website a real Getting Started docs page on its own statically generated `/docs`
route (replacing the `#docs` placeholder) and aligned the root README plus the
Jaspr and Flutter package READMEs with the shipped stable `0.4.0` family, and
`US-081` expanded `/docs` into a multi-page docs section — a shared `DocsShell`
(grouped sidebar, right-rail TOC, prev/next pager), a Flutter|Jaspr code-tab
block, and nine core pages over the shared engine surface, and `US-082`
completed the coverage with four more Concepts pages (collision, sensors,
modifiers, auto-scroll), an API Reference page, and a collapsible mobile docs
menu.
Future work should keep extending this roadmap through new product docs, story
packets, and decisions rather than by reviving the old umbrella/core topology
from the historical specs.
