# US-066 Jaspr Axis-Aware Auto-Scroll Adoption

## Status

implemented

## Lane

normal

## Product Contract

`dnd_kit_jaspr` adopts the shared axis-aware auto-scroll contract so Jaspr
scroll containers can auto-scroll horizontally through the same
`dndAutoScrollVelocity(...)` math already used by `dnd_kit` and
`dnd_kit_flutter`, while preserving current vertical behavior and SSR safety.
This story also decides whether Jaspr should keep auto-scroll execution inside
`DndAutoScroll` component state or introduce a dedicated controller surface; if
no new reuse or lifecycle need is proven, the component-owned execution model
remains the contract.

- `packages/dnd_kit_jaspr/lib/src/widgets/auto_scroll.dart`

## Acceptance Criteria

- `dnd_kit_jaspr` `DndAutoScroll` exposes axis selection with vertical default
  behavior preserved for existing call sites.
- Horizontal Jaspr auto-scroll executes through DOM `scrollLeft`,
  `scrollWidth`, and `clientWidth`, reusing the shared core velocity math
  without forking the threshold or curve.
- Browser tests cover horizontal leading/trailing edge scroll, extent
  clamping, and post-scroll collision refresh against a target scrolled into
  view.
- The story explicitly resolves the controller-abstraction question:
  - either Jaspr keeps component-owned auto-scroll execution and records why a
    dedicated controller surface is not yet justified;
  - or Jaspr introduces a dedicated controller surface with clear lifecycle and
    reuse benefits documented in code and story evidence.
- SSR safety is preserved: no top-level `dart:js_interop`, all DOM access stays
  behind `kIsWeb`, and no Flutter-only abstractions enter the Jaspr adapter.
- No Flutter package behavior changes in this story.

## Design Notes

- Commands:
  `fvm dart test packages/dnd_kit_jaspr`
  `cd packages/dnd_kit_jaspr && fvm dart test -p chrome test/auto_scroll_browser_test.dart`
  `fvm dart analyze packages/dnd_kit_jaspr`
- Queries:
  `scripts/bin/harness-cli query matrix`
  `rg -n "DndAutoScroll|DndScrollAxis|scrollLeft|scrollTop|markAllDirty|Timer" packages/dnd_kit_jaspr docs/stories/phase-15-jaspr-hardening docs/stories/phase-19-horizontal-auto-scroll`
- API:
  `DndAutoScroll`
  `DndScrollAxis`
  `dndAutoScrollVelocity`
  optional Jaspr-side auto-scroll controller surface only if the story proves it
  materially improves lifecycle/reuse over the current component-owned model.
- Domain rules:
  The shared `DndRuntime` remains the only drag engine. Jaspr owns DOM
  measuring and browser scroll execution only. Any controller-abstraction
  decision must preserve that separation and avoid inventing adapter-local
  velocity math.
- UI surfaces:
  Jaspr scroll containers under `DndScope`, plus any existing example or test
  fixture used to prove horizontal browser scrolling.

## Validation

When updating durable proof status, use numeric booleans:
`scripts/bin/harness-cli story update --id US-066 --unit 1 --integration 1 --e2e 1 --platform 1`.

| Layer | Expected proof |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | Existing shared-core axis math remains green; any Jaspr-local helper logic for axis selection or controller wiring is covered in `packages/dnd_kit_jaspr` tests. |
| Integration | `fvm dart test packages/dnd_kit_jaspr` passes with component-level coverage for horizontal configuration and teardown behavior. |
| E2E | Chrome browser auto-scroll coverage proves `scrollLeft` advances in the edge band and collision refresh works after scroll without another pointer move. |
| Platform | `fvm dart analyze packages/dnd_kit_jaspr` passes and SSR-safe import posture remains intact. |
| Release | Public exports/docs/changelog mention the Jaspr horizontal auto-scroll surface and record the controller-abstraction outcome. |

## Harness Delta

No Harness process change expected. This story extends the existing Phase 19
adapter-adoption trail and should update durable evidence with the chosen
Jaspr execution shape.

## Evidence

- Created 2026-06-18 after `US-065` closed the Flutter execution slice.
- This story is the planned Jaspr follow-up for Phase 19 and explicitly pulls
  the `DndAutoScrollController` question into scope so the adapter contract is
  decided by code and durable story evidence rather than by ad hoc discussion.
- Implemented 2026-06-18 in `packages/dnd_kit_jaspr`:
  - `DndAutoScroll` now exposes `axis`, preserves vertical as the default, and
    maps horizontal execution to `scrollLeft`, `scrollWidth`, and
    `clientWidth` while continuing to use shared `dndAutoScrollVelocity(...)`
    math.
  - Post-scroll collision refresh remains component-owned through the existing
    `markAllDirty()` + `moveDrag(currentPointer)` path, so the shared runtime
    remains the only drag engine.
  - The controller-abstraction question was resolved in favor of keeping
    component-owned execution for now: no separate Jaspr auto-scroll
    controller was introduced because the DOM node ownership, timer lifecycle,
    and SSR guards are still local to the rendered viewport and no stronger
    reuse need was proven in this slice.
- Proof captured 2026-06-18:
  - `fvm dart test packages/dnd_kit_jaspr` passed with 36 tests, including new
    component coverage for vertical default behavior and horizontal
    configuration without a separate controller.
  - `cd packages/dnd_kit_jaspr && fvm dart test -p chrome test/auto_scroll_browser_test.dart`
    passed with 6 browser tests, including horizontal trailing-edge scroll,
    horizontal post-scroll collision refresh, and horizontal extent clamping.
  - `fvm dart analyze packages/dnd_kit_jaspr` returned no issues.
