# dnd_kit

`dnd_kit` is a Flutter drag-and-drop toolkit inspired by React dnd-kit and
designed around Flutter's widget, render, gesture, and state models.

The package is intended to provide a generic draggable and droppable engine for:

- basic drag and drop;
- sortable lists and grids;
- Kanban boards;
- dashboard builders;
- canvas editors;
- form and page builders;
- admin UIs for web and desktop;
- mobile UIs with long-press dragging.

## Design Direction

The architecture is:

```text
generic DnD engine first
Flutter toolkit package second
sortable as built-in preset
Kanban as showcase
multi-container as experimental
native OS drag/drop as future package
```

The release package layout is:

```text
packages/
  dnd_kit/          # pure Dart engine
  dnd_kit_flutter/  # Flutter adapter
  dnd_kit_jaspr/    # Jaspr adapter
examples/
docs/
```

## Packages

| Package           | Role                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dnd_kit`         | Pure Dart engine: geometry, drag runtime, state, collision, modifier, sensor, registry, sortable math contracts, and the experimental multi-container helper contract. Framework-agnostic and shared by every adapter. |
| `dnd_kit_flutter` | Flutter adapter with scope, controller, draggable, droppable, overlay, sensors, measuring, auto-scroll, semantics, and stable sortable presets. |
| `dnd_kit_jaspr`   | Jaspr (Dart web) adapter: components, sortable presets, browser measuring/auto-scroll, and accessibility over the shared engine.                |

This split keeps the framework-agnostic engine reusable so adapters such as
`dnd_kit_flutter` and `dnd_kit_jaspr` build on `dnd_kit` without one adapter
depending on another's framework.

### Which package should I use?

- **Flutter app:** depend on `dnd_kit_flutter`.
- **Jaspr (Dart web) app:** depend on `dnd_kit_jaspr`. It needs no Flutter SDK.
- **Shared engine only (custom adapters, drag/drop math, contract tests):**
  depend on `dnd_kit`.

`dnd_kit` is the pure Dart engine (formerly published as `dnd_kit_core`); the
adapters build on it. All three publish dev releases during `0.x`.

## Current Status

The repository has completed Phase 0 foundation work, the Phase 1 pure Dart
core engine, the Phase 2 basic Flutter adapter, Phase 3 sensor and activation
work, Phase 4 measuring, collision runtime, modifier, and cached measuring
work, Phase 5 overlay, visual state, and auto-scroll work, the Phase 6 stable
sortable preset foundation through `US-028`, the Phase 7 Kanban showcase and
experimental multi-container sortable exploration through `US-030`, the Phase
8 production hardening work through `US-034`, the package rename/collapse work
through `US-035`, the shared-runtime multi-framework extraction through
`US-047`, the first Jaspr adapter foundation/hardening plus first public
dev-release standardization through `US-059`, and the core-as-brand package
rename (`dnd_kit_core` → `dnd_kit`) through `US-060`, plus the Flutter 3.44.2
workspace unification through `US-061`, and the Jaspr sortable preset through
`US-062`, plus the horizontal auto-scroll feasibility/design work, the
axis-aware shared-core implementation slice, and the Flutter execution-layer
adoption through `US-065`, plus the Jaspr execution-layer adoption through
`US-066`, plus the Jaspr example feature gallery through `US-067`, plus the
Jaspr drag overlay controller rebind fix through `US-068`, the shared
experimental multi-container parity slice through `US-076`, the
production-ready multi-container graduation and website showcase through
`US-078`, and the coordinated family stable `0.4.0` publication (`dnd_kit`,
`dnd_kit_flutter`, `dnd_kit_jaspr`) through `US-079`.

The living source of truth is split from historical [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) input
material into product docs, story packets, validation expectations, and decision
records under `docs/`. Use `scripts/bin/harness-cli query matrix` for durable
story proof status.

## Harness

This repo uses Harness for agent-ready implementation work. Before changing
code, read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and use `scripts/bin/harness-cli` for intake,
story, proof, decision, and trace records.

For verification, keep two lanes:

- `dart run melos run validate`: full-workspace release gate.
- `MELOS_DIFF=HEAD dart run melos run validate:affected`: changed-code lane for
  day-to-day story work.

Use another git ref such as `MELOS_DIFF=origin/main` when you want the
affected-only lane to compare your branch against a shared base.
